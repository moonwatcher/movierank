My initial, naive, implementation was highly influenced by page rank in the sense that when ranks were transferred between the two sides of the bi partite graph they were distributed among the outgoing edges. At first uniformly and later according to more "cinematically sound" logic of "above" and "bellow" the line contributors (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_the_line_(filmmaking)). This approach seem to yield an impresive ordering for people and a resonalble ordering for movies, somwehat littered by false positives or completely insignificant movies ending up with very high ranks. The weighting of the rank propegation seem to be flawed. This version is available here: https://github.com/moonwatcher/movierank/tree/master/naive

In a second implementation i attempted used a more sound logic of transferring the ranks, as described in the paper, but required an additional normalization phase. https://github.com/moonwatcher/movierank/tree/master/second

several other metrics were attempted with higher or lower bias to the distributions, esentially premutations of the second method:
